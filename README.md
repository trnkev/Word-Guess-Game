# Word Guess 

### What the project does?
- A game where the computer thinks of a random late 70s and 80s disco band. In the game, the user has to guess which band the computer is thinking about, letter by letter. The user may only type no more than twelve incorrect character before they lose and the computer thinks of another band. If the user guessed the band that the commputer is thinking about, without typing twelve incorrect characters then the user wins. 
- The user has a choice to click any key on the keyboard. If the user type an incorrect character they lose a try. The computer keeps track of the incorrect letters that the user types. Also, the computer does not allow the user to type the same incorrect character twice. 
- When the user wins, the previous image on display changes to the image of the band. 

### Why is the project useful?
This game is useful because it teaches a full-stack web developer computer logic, web-page manipulation, and project management. This game uses JavaScript for front-end web development, and the code written updates fields (wins, losses, word, guesses, etc.) on the web page. From the client's point-of-view (POV) this project looks straight forward and easy to use, but from the developer's POV, we have to seperate parts of the what we want the game to do (update wins/losses/guesses/words/images). Working on this game has taught me how to find and use resourses outside of class, build understanding on the grammar to communicate with the computer effectively.
