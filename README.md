- A game where the computer thinks of a random late 70s and 80s disco band. In the game, the user has to guess which band the computer is thinking about, letter by letter. The user may only type no more than twelve incorrect character before they lose and the computer thinks of another band. If the user guessed the band that the commputer is thinking about, without typing twelve incorrect characters then the user wins. 
- The user has a choice to click any key on the keyboard. If the user type an incorrect character they lose a try. The computer keeps track of the incorrect letters that the user types. Also, the computer does not allow the user to type the same incorrect character twice. 
- When the user wins, the previous image on display changes to the image of the band.
